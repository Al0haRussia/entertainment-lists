## Project-1

EList is a website that allows users to store books, movies, and video games they may want to watch to sorted lists.

## Installation

```

## Usage 

On the top left corner of the page, users can select if they want to search for a book, movie or video game. Once clicked, it takes them to the search bar.

The links titled "Search Engine Optimization" and "Online Reputation Management" will direct clients to the sections midway down the page.

The "Social Media Marketing" link will then direct clients to the bottom of the page.

## Updates

The first correction made were to the broken links directing clients to the different sections to the page. 

The HTML is now formatted using symantic elements rather than using straight div.

CSS has been condensed to be more concise when reading the code.
